                Hi there! My name is Rain and welcome to my learning journal.

              <p class="about__paragraph">
                I'm a self-taught developer, passionate learner, and lifelong
                explorer of all things tech and creative! This journal is where
                I document my journey, one breakthrough and bug fix at a time.

            <p class="about__paragraph">
              I didn’t take the traditional route into tech. Instead, I dove in
              headfirst—learning by doing, modeling successful platforms, and
              building projects that challenge and excite me. From frontend
              foundations to full-stack flows, I'm all about turning curiosity
              into real-world skills. My motto? Consistency beats complexity.

            <p class="about__paragraph">
              I believe the best way to grow is through hands-on practice,
              community, and staying curious. That’s why you’ll often find me
              engaging with fellow learners, reflecting on what works, and
              adapting as I go. Every mistake is a lesson. Every lesson, a
              building block.

              If you’re learning too, I hope this space gives you a spark of
              inspiration—and reminds you that you don’t need permission to
              start, just the courage to keep going.

                My self-taught journey with Scrimba.
              </h3>
              <p>
                I’m learning to code through Scrimba—one project, one challenge,
                and one breakthrough at a time.
              </p>

            <section class="post-detail__body">
              <p>
                When I first started, I had no idea how powerful a few lines of
                code could be. HTML felt like a foreign language, and CSS? A
                confusing magic trick. But the more I practiced, the more things
                started to click. What once felt impossible slowly began to feel
                intuitive.
              </p>

              <p>
                What’s made the biggest difference is
                <strong>building real projects</strong>—not just watching
                tutorials. Every component I style, every layout I fix, every
                bug I debug pushes me forward. Scrimba’s hands-on approach has
                shown me that you don’t need a CS degree to become a
                developer—you need
                <em>consistency, curiosity, and community</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are days I feel stuck. There are times I doubt myself. But
                I keep showing up. I keep pushing one line further, one lesson
                deeper. That’s how progress is made.
              </p>

              <p>
                I may be self-taught, but I’m not learning alone. I’m building
                something real—brick by brick—and this journey has only just
                begun.
